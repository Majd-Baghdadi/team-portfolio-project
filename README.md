## Team Retrospective

1) Significant technical challenge

The most significant technical challenge our team faced during the collaborative workflow was understanding Git branching and the pull request process. At the beginning, several members were unfamiliar with how branches functioned, how to synchronize local work with the remote repository, and how pull requests should be created and reviewed. This caused confusion about where to commit changes and how to correctly merge work into the develop branch. After a short internal discussion and clarification from the team lead, we established a clear workflow: each member created a personal feature branch from develop, implemented their profile page, and submitted a pull request for review before merging. This structure helped the team understand version control fundamentals and improved coordination during development.

2) Merge Conflict Resolution Process

Although we did not experience any major merge conflicts, the team learned the procedure to resolve them if they occurred. The steps involved pulling the latest version of the develop branch, identifying the files with conflict markers, manually reviewing and adjusting the differing sections, staging the corrected files, and committing with a message such as
fix: resolve merge conflict with develop branch.
This process ensured everyone understood how to maintain synchronization and preserve changes when working collaboratively.


3) Evaluation of PR and peer review process

The pull request and peer review process was effective in ensuring quality and collaboration. Each pull request required two approving reviews before merging, which encouraged careful inspection of code changes and adherence to the projectâ€™s commit message standards. Reviews also helped identify small issues early and increased communication among team members. Overall, this workflow enhanced our understanding of GitHub collaboration, maintained repository integrity, and ensured that all contributions were properly reviewed before integration.
